# ESDB (easy database)

ESDB is an in memory database which supports basic CRUD operations.

### Installation 

WIP

### Purpose and reasons

An in-memory database is a type of database that relies primarily on memory for data storage, in contrast to databases that store data on disk or SSDs. Because all data is stored and managed exclusively in main memory, it is at risk of being lost upon a process or server failure. In-memory databases can persist data on disks by storing each operation in a log or by taking snapshots. This project illustrates what an in memory database looks like for CRUD operations
